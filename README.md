# Halloween23
Halloween23 features glitter in Halloween colors (purple, orange, &amp; white), all in a seamless loop. Perfect for decorating your house with addressable LED lighting. 

**Notes**
To start, make sure the lights you plan to connect to your Arduino are addressable. Also, make sure you have the Arduino IDE downloaded & installed on a compatible system (macOS, Linux, Windows). The installation of the library FastLED is required for the code to work.
